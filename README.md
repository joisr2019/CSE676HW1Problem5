Code Reference: https://www.kaggle.com/code/demidova/handwritten-digit-recognition-with-pytorch-fnn/notebook#3.-Prepare-data

data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv

You must download the MNIST data csv from the data link, and edit the path in cell 2 to make sure that the code gets the data. (the test file is in the github, but the train file is too large to be uploaded)

Environment: You can use Jupyter notebook, and input the code. Once you change the data path to make sure it can read the data, select run, and wait for the program to finish executing.
